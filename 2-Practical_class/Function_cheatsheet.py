# Image Processing Packages

In Python, there are several libraries that can be used for image processing:
1. OpenCV (Open Computer Vision Library): one of the fastest and most widely used libraries for image processing and computer vision applications, providing around 2500 algorithms to help build models for object detection, image segmentation, etc.
2. Pillow: based on the Python Imaging Library (PIL), it offers several image processing activities such as point operations and filtering.
3. Scikit-Image: a fast & effective library for image processing tasks including filtering, feature detection, segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation, etc.
4. Numpy: a widely used library for machine learning models and can be used in image processing to manipulate pixels and mask pixel values.
5. Matplotlib: a python library known for creating visualizations, but it can also be used to extract information out of the image. Remark: It is not supportive of all file formats.

For our class, we will focus on OpenCV, Numpy and Matplotlib. OpenCV is huge! Lots of documentation is available online (https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html).

To avoid problems due to package installation, in our class, we will use Google Colab notebook.
