In our class, we will use Google Colab Notebook (you can think about it as an online version of Jupiter Notebook).

Why Google Colab?
-> Using Google Colab means that you use a "cloud computer" which already has required packages. Python packages for computer vision/image processing are often large in size, and may require some fine-tuning during the installation in different computers/OS. Therefore, Google Colab will help us to avoid problems during packages installation.

How to work with a Google Colab Notebook?
-> It is quite simple: you upload your .ipynb file to your personal Google Drive, then right-click to select "Open with Google Colab". You can find my example in this YouTube clip: https://youtu.be/D2QhUcKOJJg

What are materials for our class?
-> This folder contains all you need for the class:
(1) The Notebook template ("Computational_Biology_2025.ipynb")
(2) Syntax for important functions can be found in "Function_cheatsheet.py"
(3) Input images are in a folder with the same name

That's all!
